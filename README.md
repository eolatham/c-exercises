## Description

The `k+r/` directory contains my solutions to exercises listed in the book, [*The C Programming Language, 2nd Edition* by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-2nd-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0131103628).

Source code files containing my solutions are named in the format `e<chapter number>_<exercise number>.c`, and program descriptions are included at the top of each solution.

## Compiling

If you're running a [linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) system with [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/) and [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) installed, the provided `Makefile` is all you need.

To compile all of the exercise solutions: run the command **`make`** from the `k+r/` directory.

The resulting executable files will have the same names as their respective source code files, except that the `.c` will not be included.
